.. note:: For the *Panda 2* robot in the R&MM lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel we replace <fci-ip> with ``192.168.2.106`` at this page. 

The Franka Control Interface (FCI) allows a fast and direct low-level bidirectional connection to the Arm and Hand.
It provides the current status of the robot and enables its direct real-time control at 1 kHz with an external workstation PC (our desktop) connected via Ethernet.
We refer to the |frankaemika-fci-overview| for more information about its specifications.

Clone an existing project
--------------------------

Clone the project and build ``libfranka`` and ``franka_ros``:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/panda-brubotics/franka_constrained_control.git
   cd path/to/franka_constrained_control/libfranka
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   cmake --build .
   cd ../../catkin_ws/src/franka_ros
   catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFranka_DIR:PATH=/path/to/libfranka/build

.. warning::

   The path of ``-DFranka_DIR:PATH`` MUST be an absolute path to the libfranka's build directory.


Now that the project is built, you can use catkin_make without specifying the build type or the build directory, i.e.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd path/to/franka_constrained_control/catkin_ws
   catkin_make

Create your own project
-----------------------

.. note :: If you want to make an extension or improvement to the franka_constrained_control project,
           it is better to clone the existing project as is explained in the previous section.
           However, if you like to make a new project with the same libfranka and ros version as we used,
           then you have to follow this section.

This tutorial is an adapted version of the official |frankaemika-linux-installation|.

.. |frankaemika-linux-installation| raw:: html

    <a href="https://frankaemika.github.io/docs/installation_linux.html" target="_blank">Franka Emika installation tutorial</a>

First of all make sure that ROS is installed :

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-melodic-libfranka ros-melodic-franka-ros

Before building from source, please uninstall existing installations of ``libfranka`` and ``franka_ros`` to avoid conflicts:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt remove "*libfranka*"

Create a directory (or a git directory if you want to make a git repository) before installing ``libfranka`` and ``franka_ros``.

Install libfranka
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To build libfranka, install the following dependencies from Ubuntuâ€™s package manager:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install build-essential cmake git libpoco-dev libeigen3-dev

Then, download the source code by cloning |frankaemika-libfranka-github| in your directory (or git repository):

.. |frankaemika-libfranka-github| raw:: html

    <a href="https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka" target="_blank">libfranka</a>

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/frankaemika/libfranka
   cd libfranka

By default, this will check out the newest release of ``libfranka``.
However, we want to use the version *0.7.1*, so we have to change the branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   git checkout 0.7.1
   git submodule update

In the libfranka directory, create a build directory and run CMake:

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   cmake --build .

Try to launch files in the ``build/examples`` directory to see if the installation is completed.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd build/examples
   ./echo_robot_state <fci-ip>
   ./print_joint_poses <fci-ip>

When you can run the examples, ``libfranka`` is installed properly, so you are ready to install ``franka_ros``.

Install franka_ros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go to your directory (or git repository) and create a catkin workspace :

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
   cd catkin_ws
   source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.sh
   catkin_init_workspace src

Then clone the |frankaemika-franka_ros-github| repository by executing the following command:

.. |frankaemika-franka_ros-github| raw:: html

    <a href="https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros" target="_blank">franka_ros</a>

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/frankaemika/franka_ros src/franka_ros

By default, this will check out the newest release of ``franka_ros``.
However, we want to use the version *0.6.0* since with the latest version there are some problems such that even the franka_example_controllers cannot be launched.
So we have to change the branch:

.. code-block:: bash

   cd src/franka_ros
   git checkout 0.6.0

Install any missing dependencies and build the packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro melodic -y --skip-keys libfranka
   catkin_make -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DFranka_DIR:PATH=/path/to/libfranka/build
   source devel/setup.sh

.. warning ::

   The path of ``-DFranka_DIR:PATH`` MUST be an absolute path to the libfranka's build directory.

.. note ::

   Once the problems with the latest franka_ros version are solved, we can try this latest franka_ros and accompanying libfranka version.

Since we don't want to work with git submodules, we remove all the submodules by following these steps: 

* Delete the relevant line from the .gitmodules file.
* Delete the relevant section from .git/config.
* Run git rm --cached path_to_submodule (no trailing slash).



.. _Robot_Control:

Control the robot with ROS
-----------------------------

.. note:: For the *Panda 2* robot in the R&MM lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel we replace <fci-ip> with ``192.168.2.106``

Here we will explain how to test the ``franka_ros`` examples and how to make your own controller.

Test franka_example_controllers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To test that libfranka and franka_ros are installed properly, you can run the franka_example_controllers.

Open a terminal, go to the catkin_ws, source the setup.bash, and build the project.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd path/to/your_project/catkin_ws
   source devel/setup.bash
   catkin_make

You will have to source the setup.bash everytime you open a new terminal and you have to build the project everytime you change a cpp file.

model_example_controller
************************

To run the *model_example_controller* example, the robot can stay in the **interactive (white)** state,
since this example doesn't send any commands to the robot, but only gets access to e.g. measured joint data and robot dynamics.

.. code-block:: bash

   roslaunch franka_example_controllers model_example_controller.launch

After executing this line, rviz will open and will show the robot in its current configuration.
When you manually guide the robot to another configuration and release the enabling and guiding button,
you will see that the robot configuration in rviz is updated to the configuration you manually guided the robot to.
In the meanwhile you can see the updated values of e.g. the fourth joint pose and the joint angles in the terminal.

.. admonition:: todo

	Replace image below with printscreen of default output from the model_example_controller.


move_to_start
******************

To run the *move_to_start* example, put the robot in the **interactive (white)** state and manually guide the robot to an arbitrary configuration.
Then set the robot in the **activated (blue)** state before executing move_to_start.

.. code-block:: bash

   roslaunch franka_example_controllers move_to_start.launch robot_ip:=<fci-ip> load_gripper:=true

The robot should normally return in the following configuration that is required to start from for most of the franka_example_controllers.

.. admonition:: todo

	Replace gif below. Make video of move_to_start example and add gif of it in the tutorial. 



joint_impedance_example_controller
************************************

To run the *joint_impedance_example_controller*, you have to put the robot in the **activated (blue)** state and
you have to execute *move_to_start*, such that the robot is in its start configuration.
Then execute the following.

.. code-block:: bash

   roslaunch franka_example_controllers joint_impedance_example_controller.launch robot_ip:=<fci-ip> load_gripper:=true

.. admonition:: todo

	Explain what you should see with a video or gif below. Make video of joint_impedance_example_controller and add gif of it in the tutorial. 

.. note :: If the robot briskly stopts because of a problem or because you have stopped the robot with the ``CTRL+C`` command,
           you will not be able to run another program although the display lights didn't change color.
           To be able to run another program, you will have to close the external activation device (press down) and open it again (pull up).


cartesian_impedance_example_controller
**************************************

To run the *cartesian_impedance_example_controller*, you have to put the robot in the **activated (blue)** state and
you have to execute *move_to_start*, such that the robot is in its start configuration.
Then execute the following.

.. code-block:: bash

   roslaunch franka_example_controllers cartesian_impedance_example_controller.launch robot_ip:=<fci-ip> load_gripper:=true

.. admonition:: todo

	Explain what you should see with a video or gif below. Make video of cartesian_impedance_example_controller and do screen capture of RViz. Trim both videos and add gif of it in the tutorial. 

Make your own controller
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To create your own controller in an existing project, we follow the tutorial *Starting to Write a New Controller* that is written on the |frankaemika-community| website.
You have to make an account if you want to see posts in this community. We encourage you to do this!

.. |frankaemika-community| raw:: html

    <a href="https://www.franka-community.de" target="_blank">Franka Community</a>

What follows is copied from the Franka Community website and can help you whenever you want to make a new controller or want to adapt the name of an existing controller.

1) In catkin_ws/src, you will see franka_example_controllers.
   In catkin_ws/src create a new folder and name it whatever you like (new_controllers).
   This is where you will keep your new controllers.

2) Create a **src** folder in new_controllers.
   Copy an example controller into here (I copied the joint_impedance_example_controller.cpp from catkin_ws/src/franka_example_controllers/src).
   Rename it to anything you want (new_controller_1.cpp). In new_controller_1.cpp, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers
   *  joint_impedance_example_controller, change it to new_controller_1
   *  JointImpedanceExampleController, change it to NewController1

3) Create an **include** folder in new_controllers.
   Create a new_controllers folder in include.
   Copy the joint_impedance_example_controller.h file from franka_example_controllers/include/franka_example_controller into new_controllers/include/new_controllers
   and rename it to new_controller_1.h. In new_controller_1.h, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers
   *  JointImpedanceExampleController, change it to NewController1

4) Create a **launch** folder in new_controllers.
   Copy robot.rviz from franka_example_controller/launch into new_controllers/launch.
   Also copy joint_impedance_example_controller.launch into here and rename it to new_controller_1.launch.
   In this launch file, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers
   *  joint_impedance_example_controller, change it to new_controller_1

5) Create a **config** folder in new_controllers. Copy the franka_example_controllers.yalm file from franka_example_controllers/config into new_controllers/config.
   Rename it to new_controllers.yaml. Only keep joint_impedance_example_controller and its parameters.
   Delete all other controllers and their parameters. Next, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers
   *  joint_impedance_example_controller, change it to new_controller_1
   *  JointImpedanceExampleController, change it to NewController1

6) Copy these folders (and the files in them): **cfg**, **msg**, **scripts** from franka_example_controllers into new_controllers.

7) Copy the **package.xml** file from franka_example_controllers to new_controllers. Next, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers

8) Copy the **franka_example_controllers_plugin.xml** file from franka_example_controllers to new_controllers.
   Only keep the JointImpedanceExampleController class and delete the rest. Next, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers
   *  JointImpedanceExampleController, change it to NewController1

9) Copy the **CMakeList.txt** from franka_example_controller to new_controller. Next, wherever you see:

   *  franka_example_controllers, change it to new_controllers
   *  joint_impedance_example_controller, change it to new_controller_1
   *  In the add_library part, delete the other controllers (we only need ours).
