Constraint-Based Planning with a Stereo Camera
==============================================
This tutorial explains how to use the Stereolabs ZED 2 camera for the constraint-based planning 
of a Franka Emika Panda robot in Human-Robot Coexistence scenarios. 
Part of the documentation is specifically for the use of the robot in the R&MM lab at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
the other part is generally written such that researchers in other research groups can also follow this tutorial.
